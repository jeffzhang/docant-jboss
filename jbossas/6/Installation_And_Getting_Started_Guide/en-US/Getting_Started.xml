                        <para>
                         You must have a working installation of <emphasis>JDK 1.6</emphasis> before you install JBoss Application Server. You can install the 32-bit or 64-bit JVM depending on your requirements. 
                        </para>
                        <para>Be sure to create an environment variable that points to the JDK installation directory and call it <literal>JAVA_HOME</literal>. Add <literal>$JAVA_HOME/bin</literal> to the system path to be able to run <literal>java</literal> from the command line. You can do this by adding the following lines to the <filename>.bashrc</filename> file in your home directory. In this example /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_18 is the JDK installation directory.
               <programlisting>
               export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.6.0_18 export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin </programlisting> 

		Set this variable for the user account doing the installation and also for the user account that will run the server.  </para>
                <para>
                 Make sure that the <literal>java</literal> executable is in your path and that you are using an appropriate version. To verify your Java environment, type <literal>java -version</literal> at the shell prompt and you should see something like this:
                             <programlisting>
                                [root@hostname]$ java -version
                                java version "1.6.0_18"
                                Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_18-b07)
                                Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 16-b13, mixed mode)
                            </programlisting>
                  </para>
