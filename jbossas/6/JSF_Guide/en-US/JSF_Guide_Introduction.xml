	      In the past, using a JEE application server meant using the JSF implementation that ships with it.  
            However, there are subtle differences between JSF implementations.  Applications written for Mojarra
            don't always run well on MyFaces.  There are sometimes backward compatibility issues between JSF
            specification levels.  An application written for JSF 1.2 won't always run on JSF 2.0.

	      JBoss AS6 is designed for maximum flexibility in JSF deployments.  With JBoss AS6, you can use the 
            default JSF implementation, use a secondary JSF implementation, or bundle
            your own JSF implementation with the WAR.  You can have different applications in the same server instance 
            that use different implementations.  Also, you can create your own JSF Configurations that include
            a JSF implementation, extra libraries, and configuration parameters.  Then assign the configuration
            to one or more applications.

        In this guide, we'll step through a simple JSF example.  Then we will go through all the powerful deployment
        options for JSF applications.
