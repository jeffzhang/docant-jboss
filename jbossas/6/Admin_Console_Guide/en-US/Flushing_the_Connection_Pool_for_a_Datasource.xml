		In order to flush the connection pool associated with a Datasource you navigate to the Datasource you are interested in, select its Control tab and then push the <emphasis role="bold">FLUSH</emphasis> button. Once the Control operation is executed, the Operation status is returned and listed in the Operations History section at the bottom of the main pane. Multiple operations can be executed and a history of results is maintained until the JBoss Application Server instance is restarted.
